## How do I approach designing software?

##### Working on this project has given me a new perspective on graphics creation. I now have some understanding of what is happening behind the scenes in graphic creation programs. While I may not use OpenGL to code graphics from scratch, I now have an appreciation and better understanding for how it is done. That will help me to better understand how to work with any graphics engine.
##### I used the software development lifecycle while building my 3D scene. First, I looked for the requirements of the current step. Then, using course resources, I learned how to design and implement the solution. Finally, I tested the solution for functionality. When I started working on the project, I didnâ€™t focus enough on understanding the solutions. About one-quarter of the way into the project, I went back and made sure that I fully understood the solutions that I had created. I believe that step was critical for success in the project. At the end of the project, I looked at areas of the code that could be cleaned up, modularized, or deleted. This helped the code to be more readable.




## How do I approach developing programs?

##### I used an iterative development process when building this project. I started with a basic blank screen, then added basic 2D objects and aspect ratio calculations. From there, I built a simple 3D object (pyramid). Next, I continued to add functionality. I built camera controls and then tied those to keyboard and mouse inputs. Next, I added texture to the object, then I started to customize lighting for the scene. From there, it was a matter of adding more 3D objects and refining colors, textures, and lighting.
##### From the onset, this project seeming huge and intimidating. Using the iterative development process broke the project into manageable pieces. I will use this approach on future projects. By breaking the project into manageable pieces, it is no longer intimidating. Adding complex lighting to the scene is a daunting task. However, adding a simple point light and then a directional light caster are simple tasks.




## How can computer science help me in reaching my goals?

##### As mentioned earlier, the knowledge learned from this class could be applied both directly and indirectly to my current career and provide more opportunities for future careers. In my current career, running a building automation system, I build some graphics for the front end. However, it is more dragging and dropping 3D clip art from built in libraries. Now, I feel confident that if I need to create animated 3D graphics from scratch then I will be able to do that. Also, having this experience may open some opportunities. There are many computer science careers that are related to graphic creation.
